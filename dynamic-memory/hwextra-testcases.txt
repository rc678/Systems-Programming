1.) Freeing pointers that were never allocated

Input: int y;
       free(y);
Expected output: "Trying to free a a pointer that was never allocated."

2.) Freeing pointer to dynamic memory that was not returned from malloc.

Input: int *p = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
       free(p + 10);
Expected output: "Trying to free a pointer to dynamic memory that was not returned from my_malloc"

3.) Freeing the same pointer more than once

Input: int *p = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
       free(p);
       free(p);
Expected output: "successfully freed"
                 "Trying to free a pointer that has been already freed."
                 
4.) Mallocing and freeing multiple times

Input: int *p = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
       free(p);
       p = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
       free(p);
Expected output: "successfully freed"
                 "successfully freed"

5.) Saturation

Input: while(malloc(100 * sizeof(int)))
       {
              
       }
Expected output: "cannot allocate because there is no mmory left"

6.) Freeing memory of allocated data

Input: int *p = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
       free(p);
Expected Output: "successfully freed"

7.) Freeing in the middle of two memory blocks

Input: char* p = malloc(10*sizeof(char));
       int* ptr = (int*)malloc(10* sizeof(int));
       free(p + 12);
       
Expected output: "Trying to free a pointer to dynamic memory that was not returned from my_malloc"
